# Movie search engine to explore movies and series

Welcome to the Movie Search Engine project! This application, built using Create React App, allows you to search for your favorite movies effortlessly.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these simple steps:

### `git clone <(https://github.com/mandar2289/API-consumer)>`
### `cd movie-search-engine`

## Install Dependencies

### `npm install`

## Run the Application

### `npm start`

This command launches the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000/movies to view it in your browser. The page will automatically reload if you make any edits, and you can see lint errors in the console.

## Testing

To run tests for the project, use the following command, Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

Thank you for using the Movie Search Engine! If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out. Happy coding!
